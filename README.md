# Smart Accident Alert System
&nbsp;
> ## Introduction

Due to increasing number of vehicles on roads, accidents are also increasing, and consequently there have been sharp increase in mortalities caused due to road traffic injury.

Smart Accident Alert System tries to curb accidents. It is accident detection and messaging system using GPS, vibration sensor and GSM module, in which the vibration sensor is used as an input to the system and corresponding response is analyzed by Arduino. If an accident occurs then SMS is send to registered mobile number so that immediate help can be provided.
The SMS will be sent after 10 seconds so that if the alarm if false, say because of just a bump, the driver can reset the module with the help of a button.

> ## Novelty of the System

* Driver will be intimated about ‘accident prone zone’ based on the vehicle's coordinates. Hence , the driver will become cautious while driving. 

* An extra module, Camera, is included for further enhancement of the Accident Alert System, which will take picture of the driver in regular intervals and send them to a server via wi-fi. This will help in jugding the behaviour of the driver while driving.

> ## How To Use This Repo

Run following commands

* `git clone https://github.com/skgshivam/Accident_alert_system.git
* `cd Accident_alert_system`
* Repo is organsied into two folder
  * __Docs__ - Contain documents regarding project which were refrenced while making the system.
  * __Code__ - Contain running code for the system.
* `cd Code`
* Run `GSM-GPS.ino`. This file is used to run GPS, GSM and Vibration Sensor module.
* Run `Camera.ino` and then open `ReadSerialPortWin.exe` in order to capture image from Arducam.

> ## These connections you have to make in the Arduino UNO (according to the code)
* RXPin : 4
* TXPin : 2
* GPSBaud = 9600
* SoftwareSerial ss(RXPin, TXPin)
* LiquidCrystal lcd(A3,A2,A1,10,9,8)
* SoftwareSerial mySerial(5,6) // 5 RX 6 TX
* LED_Pin : 7
* vibr_Pin : 3
